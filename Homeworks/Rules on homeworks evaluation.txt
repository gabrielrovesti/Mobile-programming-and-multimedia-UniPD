The homework get evaluated as "Competente" (You got skills) or "Non competente" (you haven't got the skills).
It is not strictly mandatory to pass them all or be present to them all to avoid the oral questions, but this is strictly recommended. 

In case you get "Not approved", you will see why in the comments, it you get the good one you will see no comments on the assignment Moodle section.
